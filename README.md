Personal Portfolio Website (React JS)

Hi 👋

This is my personal portfolio website built using React JS, created to introduce myself, showcase my skills, and highlight my journey as a Software Developer. I wanted this portfolio to feel simple, modern, and easy to navigate while still looking visually appealing.
